        <p> <strong>Mother Teresa:</strong> Mother Teresa was the founder of the Order of the Missionaries of
            Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to helping the poor</p>
        <p>1910: A saint is born.</p>

        <p>Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Macedonia, on August 26, 1910. Mother Teresa’s
            parents, Nikola and Dranafile Bojaxhiu, were of Albanian descent; her father was an entrepreneur who worked
            as a construction contractor and a trader of medicines and other goods. The Bojaxhius were a devoutly
            Catholic family, and Nikola was deeply involved in the local church as well as in city politics as a vocal
            proponent of Albanian independence.</p>

        <p>In 1919, when Mother Teresa — then Agnes — was only eight years old, her father suddenly fell ill and died.
            While the cause of his death remains unknown, many have speculated that political enemies poisoned him.

            In the aftermath of her father's death, Agnes became extraordinarily close to her mother, a pious and
            compassionate woman who instilled in her daughter a deep commitment to charity. Although by no means
            wealthy, Drana Bojaxhiu extended an open invitation to the city's destitute to dine with her family. "My
            child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others," she counseled her daughter. When
            Agnes asked who the people eating with them were, her mother uniformly responded, "Some of them are our
            relations, but all of them are our people."</p>

        <p>Agnes attended a convent-run primary school and then a state-run secondary school. As a girl, she sang in the
            local Sacred Heart choir and was often asked to sing solos. The congregation made an annual pilgrimage to
            the Church of the Black Madonna in Letnice, and it was on one such trip at the age of 12 that she first felt
            a calling to religious life. Six years later, in 1928, an 18-year-old Agnes Bojaxhiu decided to become a nun
            and set off for Ireland to join the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin. It was there that she took the name Sister
            Mary Teresa after Saint Thérèse of Lisieux.

            A year later, Sister Mary Teresa traveled on to Darjeeling, India, for the novitiate period; in May 1931,
            she made her First Profession of Vows. Afterward, she was sent to Calcutta, where she was assigned to teach
            at Saint Mary's High School for Girls, a school run by the Loreto Sisters and dedicated to teaching girls
            from the city's poorest Bengali families. Sister Teresa learned to speak both Bengali and Hindi fluently as
            she taught geography and history and dedicated herself to alleviating the girls' poverty through education.

            On May 24, 1937, she took her Final Profession of Vows to a life of poverty, chastity and obedience. As was
            the custom for Loreto nuns, she took on the title of "Mother" upon making her final vows and thus became
            known as Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa continued to teach at Saint Mary's, and in 1944 she became the
            school's principal. Through her kindness, generosity and unfailing commitment to her students' education,
            she sought to lead them to a life of devotion to Christ. "Give me the strength to be ever the light of their
            lives, so that I may lead them at last to you," she wrote in prayer.</p>

        <p>On September 10, 1946, Mother Teresa experienced a second calling, the "call within a call" that would
            forever transform her life. She was riding in a train from Calcutta to the Himalayan foothills for a retreat
            when she said Christ spoke to her and told her to abandon teaching to work in the slums of Calcutta aiding
            the city's poorest and sickest people.

            Since Mother Teresa had taken a vow of obedience, she could not leave her convent without official
            permission. After nearly a year and a half of lobbying, in January 1948 she finally received approval to
            pursue this new calling. That August, donning the blue-and-white sari that she would wear in public for the
            rest of her life, she left the Loreto convent and wandered out into the city. After six months of basic
            medical training, she voyaged for the first time into Calcutta's slums with no more specific a goal than to
            aid "the unwanted, the unloved, the uncared for."</p>

        <p>In 1971, Mother Teresa traveled to New York City to open her first American-based house of charity, and in
            the summer of 1982, she secretly went to Beirut, Lebanon, where she crossed between Christian East Beirut
            and Muslim West Beirut to aid children of both faiths. In 1985, Mother Teresa returned to New York and spoke
            at the 40th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly. While there, she also opened Gift of Love, a
            home to care for those infected with HIV/AIDS.</p>

        <p>In 1979, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. She died in September 1997
            and was beatified in October 2003. In December 2015, Pope Francis recognized a second miracle attributed to
            Mother Teresa, clearing the way for her to be canonized on September 4, 2016.</p>

        <p>In February 1965, Pope Paul VI bestowed the Decree of Praise upon the Missionaries of Charity, which prompted
            Mother Teresa to begin expanding internationally. By the time of her death in 1997, the Missionaries of
            Charity numbered more than 4,000 — in addition to thousands more lay volunteers — with 610 foundations in
            123 countries around the world.</p>
